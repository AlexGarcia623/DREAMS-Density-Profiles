# The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Dark Matter Density Profiles

Based on the project of the same name, Alex M. Garcia et al. (In Preparation). This repository contains the scripts, data, and figure associated with the paper. I provide a short description of the files/directories below for convenience. 


## Directories

- `Databases`/`Models`/`Outputs`: Should be empty on Github, but are holders for the Neural Network emulator databases, models, and Outputs
- `data`: Contains all of the data associated with this paper
- `figs`: Contains all of the pdfs associated with this paper

## Files

- `Figure2.py`: Loads in density profiles and breaks them down into the DREAMS parameters (see `Figure2.pdf` in `/figs/`)
- `Figure3.py`: Loads in the emulator and makes predictions for gNFW normalized parameters (see `Figure3.pdf` in `/figs/`)
